# Simon-Says-Game
A simple memory game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Watch the color sequence and repeat it by clicking the buttons in order. The sequence gets longer with each level. If you make a mistake, the game ends and shows your score. Fun way to practice DOM manipulation and game logic!
